Description: STADyUM is a package with functionality for analyzing nascent
    RNA read counts to infer transcription rates. This includes utilities for
    processing experimental nascent RNA read counts as well as for simulating 
    PRO-seq data. Rates such as initiation, pause release and landing pad 
    occupancy are estimated from either synthetic or experimental data. There 
    are also options for varying pause sites and including steric hindrance of
    initiation in the model.
