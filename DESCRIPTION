Description: STADyUM is a package with functionality for analyzing nascent
  RNA read counts to infer transcription rates. This includes utilities for processing
  experimental nascent RNA read counts as well as for simulating PRO-seq data. Rates 
  such as initiation, pause release and landing pad occupancy are estimated 
  from either synthetic or experimental data. There are also options for varying pause sites and including 
  steric hindrance of initiation in the model.
